# Basically-Pong
This game takes two players to play. 
Just like standard Pong, one player controls a paddle while the other player controls the other paddle. 
The player on the left uses 'W' and 'A' to move their paddle and the player on the right uses 'up' and 'down' on the arrow keys.
The game ends when one player doesn't return the ball. 
This was created using pygame.
